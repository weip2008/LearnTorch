> LSTM, or Long Short-Term Memory, is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture designed to model sequential data. LSTM networks are particularly effective at capturing long-term dependencies in data, which traditional RNNs struggle with due to the problem of vanishing or exploding gradients during training.
