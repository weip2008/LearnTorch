Improving a model's performance involves several strategies that include optimizing the architecture, tuning hyperparameters, and possibly improving the training process. Here are some suggestions to potentially improve the accuracy of your CNN model for stock data:

### 1. **Increase Model Complexity**:
   - Add more convolutional layers or increase the number of filters.
   - Add dropout layers to prevent overfitting.

### 2. **Adjust Learning Rate and Optimizer**:
   - Experiment with different learning rates.
   - Try different optimizers like Adam, RMSprop, or SGD with momentum.

### 3. **Data Augmentation**:
   - If applicable, augment your data to provide more variety during training.

### 4. **Batch Normalization**:
   - Add batch normalization layers to stabilize and accelerate training.

### 5. **Early Stopping and Checkpoints**:
   - Use early stopping to prevent overfitting.
   - Save the best model based on validation accuracy.

### 6. **Regularization**:
   - Add L2 regularization to your convolutional and fully connected layers.

### 7. **More Training Data**:
   - If possible, increase the amount of training data.

Here's an example of how you could modify your model with some of these suggestions:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class StockCNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(StockCNN, self).__init__()
        # Define the convolutional layers
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv1d(in_channels=1, out_channels=32, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.bn1 = nn.BatchNorm1d(32)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv1d(in_channels=32, out_channels=64, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.bn2 = nn.BatchNorm1d(64)
        self.conv3 = nn.Conv1d(in_channels=64, out_channels=128, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.bn3 = nn.BatchNorm1d(128)
        
        # Define the max pooling layer
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool1d(kernel_size=2, stride=2, padding=0)
        
        # Define the dropout layer
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(0.5)
        
        # Define the fully connected layers
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(128 * (150 // 8), 256)  # Adjust size based on pooling
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(256, 64)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(64, 2)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        # Apply convolutional layers with ReLU activation, batch normalization, and pooling
        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.bn1(self.conv1(x))))
        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.bn2(self.conv2(x))))
        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.bn3(self.conv3(x))))
        
        # Flatten the tensor for the fully connected layers
        x = x.view(-1, 128 * (150 // 8))
        
        # Apply dropout before fully connected layers
        x = self.dropout(F.relu(self.fc1(x)))
        x = F.relu(self.fc2(x))
        
        # Output layer
        x = self.fc3(x)
        return x

# Training code example
# Assuming you have your data in a DataLoader called train_loader and validation_loader
import torch.optim as optim

model = StockCNN()
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

num_epochs = 20
best_val_acc = 0.0

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    model.train()
    for inputs, labels in train_loader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
    
    # Validate the model
    model.eval()
    correct = 0
    total = 0
    with torch.no_grad():
        for inputs, labels in validation_loader:
            outputs = model(inputs)
            _, predicted = torch.max(outputs.data, 1)
            total += labels.size(0)
            correct += (predicted == labels).sum().item()
    
    val_acc = 100 * correct / total
    print(f'Epoch {epoch + 1}, Validation Accuracy: {val_acc:.2f}%')
    
    # Save the best model
    if val_acc > best_val_acc:
        best_val_acc = val_acc
        torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'best_stock_cnn.pth')

print(f'Best Validation Accuracy: {best_val_acc:.2f}%')
```

### Key Changes and Additions:
1. **Increased the number of filters** in the convolutional layers.
2. **Added Batch Normalization** after each convolutional layer.
3. **Increased the size of the fully connected layers**.
4. **Added Dropout** before the fully connected layers.
5. **Used Adam optimizer** with a learning rate of 0.001.
6. **Validation and Model Checkpointing** during training.

These modifications should provide a stronger baseline and better generalization for your stock data CNN model. Experiment with these changes and further tune hyperparameters as needed.
